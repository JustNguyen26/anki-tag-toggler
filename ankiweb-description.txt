Tag Toggler is an add-on for Anki 2 that lets you quickly add and edit tags
while reviewing.  You can customize keyboard shortcuts for editing all tags on
the current card, as well as quickly adding, deleting, or toggling specific
preset tags.  Optionally, you can bury or suspend the note after applying the
tags.

For example, here are some ways that I use the add-on:
<ul>
<li> Toggle the 'hard' tag on the current card:
<code>    'H': {'tags': 'hard', 'action': 'toggle'}</code>
<li> Add a 'TODO' tag and bury cards in the current note:
<code>    'T': {'tags': 'TODO', 'after': 'bury-note'}</code>
<li> Add an 'easy' tag and suspend the current card:
<code>    'A': {'tags': 'easy', 'after': 'suspend-card'}</code>
</ul>

Customization is fairly straightforward, with instructions in the source code.

Tag Toggler was inspired by the Quick Tagging add-on by Cayenne Boyer.
